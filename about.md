{: data-content="intro"}

Hi I'm Athisa.

A student currently living in *Indonesia* with experiences studying abroad in *Japan*
and the *United States*. More specifically in the metropolitan city of *Jakarta*, gourmet center of
*Osaka*, and tech capital of *San Jose*.

I speak fluent *Indonesian* and *English*. At present, learning *Japanese*.

{: data-content="programming"}

I started programming during high school using *C++* for competitive programming purposes.
This also lead me to learning *Python*, *Java*, and *Assembly*.

Throughout various Hackathons, I employ various *JavaScript* modules such as React and Node being the most common.

As with others, I also have an interest in *Machine Learning*. Taking Coursera lessons and experimenting
in Kaggle is one of my past hobbies.

{: data-content="anime & weebiness"}

The anime that started my journey towards anime was *K-On* which caught my attention because of the art style.
Since then I have watched over *400+ anime titles*. Some of my favorite anime are *Grand Blue*, *Youjo Senki*, and *Kokoro Connect*.

Light novels and mangas are also some of my favorite reading medium. While I enjoy a broad range of manga the same cannot be said for
light novels.

Some of my favorite mangas are *Spy X Family* and *Sengoku Komachi Kurou Tan!*. Light novels that I enjoy are few such as
*Isekai Tensei Soudoki* and *Common Sense of a Duke's Daughter*.

The world of music and videos are nonetheless similar due to the fact that I consume more curated Japanese songs
and videos than the average man. Artists such as *Yorushika* and *Orangestar* dominate my daily playlist.

Personally, I also go on Youtube to get my daily dose of Virtual Youtuber clips from some of my favorite such as
*Usada Pekora*, *Minato Aqua*, and *Kagura Mea*.

{: data-content="games"}

Video games have been a part of my life since I was little coming from a small Korean game called
*Lost Saga*. I eventually moved onto more popular games such as *League of Legends*, *Dota 2*, and *CS:GO*.

While I do play Dota 2, as a matter of fact I am more invested in *League of Legends* as I have played
since Season 2 in the North American server reaching high platinum by season 4. My favourite champion is *Lucian*.

Playing *CS:GO* was a blast during my high school days, I managed to reached LEM rank and stopped. I also sometimes play
*Apex Legends* but in a more casual manner.

However, my best time playing online games was *FINAL FANTASY XIV* the MMORPG. Raiding and levelling with friends
was a blast. As I mostly hardcore raided since start of Shadowbringers and killed all three Ultimates so as
achieving week one clears in Savage tiers.

For singleplayer games, I do play them albeit quite rarely. Some of my favorite single player games are *Yakuza 0*,
*Persona 5*, and *Witcher 3*. There are lots more single player games that I like as my tastes lean in story-driven
games.
