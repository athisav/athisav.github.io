I"â<p>Virtual Youtubers or more commonly known as VTubers are becoming a hot topic
in the anime community lately. Whether it being clips in Twitter or fan arts being shared
in Pixiv, the rise of these idols are now seen across multiple platforms. What makes
these virtual idols popular among the anime loving masses? When did they start
getting popular and swarming my Youtube recommendations feed? These are some of the
questions I ask myself as I dig into my personal journey into Virtual Youtubers.</p>

<hr />

<p>The year 2017, Donald Trump sworn into the oval office was the biggest
news around. However as for myself, there are better things to pay attention to
in the realm of programming and technology advancement. Browsing through Youtube
was a common occurrence for me in between college classes. One thing that caught my eye
was a Japanese video recommended to me from a channel called <em>Kizuna AI</em>. Having been
interested in Machine Learning and so forth I was very intrigued.</p>

<p>A glimpse of her channel showed me a variety of gaming videos and video logs. Watching her
I was quite disappointed as it did not to be an artificially created video made by Machine
Learning as I had hoped. Her videos did not strike me fancy as they were mostly loud and fast
talking rants akin to popular gaming Youtubers. Further search results showed me a different channel
equally as popular named <em>Kaguya Luna</em>, this further worsened my impression on Virtual Youtubers as
she was even more rowdy. Nevertheless, their view counts and subscribers amount rather a lot surprising
me.</p>

<p>Over the years, memory of my encounter with the two Virtual Youtubers faded. There were mentions
of an incident concerning Kizuna AI that trended quite a while in Twitter. As a result, most of
Virtual Youtuber enthusiasts moved over to smaller and upcoming Virtual Youtubers. However, I was still not
convinced to partake in this form of entertainment. This however changed during the late 2019 where my
preconceived ideas of Virtual Youtubers are challenged.</p>

<p>Circulating through Twitter was a video of an anime-styled white fox singing ‚ÄúScatman‚Äù, this quickly
garnered views and my attention was drawn towards it thinking about how impressive the Live2D animations
and creativity this video has. However, I quickly realized that this is a live captured person singing
and not some edited masterpiece. This intrigued me even further as a few days later a popular mobile game,
Azur Lane, released some Virtual Youtuber inspired limited characters.</p>

<p>Clearly, the international anime community took notice as my Youtube recommendations started pouring
clips after clips of English translated Virtual Youtuber gameplay. Eventually I found myself watching
a translated clip on <em>Natsuiro Matsuri</em> not expecting anything. Shocked, I found myself enjoying
myself more than I thought I would and this coming from a background of not traditionally watching Youtubers.</p>

<p>Sooner or later, I found myself in a rabbit hole watching various Virtual Youtubers from a company called
<em>Hololive</em> and a select few from <em>Nijisanji</em>. Knowing this, I found my new guilty pleasure in watching daily
translated English clips and at times watching their livestreams.</p>

<p>Before long I notice that more and more people are watching these Virtual Youtubers particularly from the anime
community. Reddit posts filled up, Discords become more active, and Twitter posted more Virtual Youtuber related
tweets. A turning point for the international community was when <em>Hololive</em> decided to add <em>Kiryu Coco</em> an English
and Japanese speaking Virtual Youtuber. The fact that <em>Hololive</em> also noticed a market outside of Japan adding in
various Chinese Virtual Youtubers and Indonesian-English speaking Virtual Youtubers means that they noticed the
potential of a broader market.</p>

<p>At this point I only follow a number of Hololive clips and streams such as <em>Usada Pekora</em>, <em>Minato Aqua</em>, <em>Kiryu
Coco</em> and <em>Ayunda Risu</em>. Currently I do not really follow a lot of <em>Nijisanji</em> Virtual Youtubers since I believe
that <em>Hololive</em> has a more compelling livestreaming experience and detailed character roster. As of late I started
to speculate why the boom on Virtual Youtubers happened and what are their advantages as well as disadvantages
against conventional Youtubers or Twitch streamers.</p>
