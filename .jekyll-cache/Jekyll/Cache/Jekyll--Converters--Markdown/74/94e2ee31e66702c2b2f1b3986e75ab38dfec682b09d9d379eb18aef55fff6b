<hr data-content="intro" />

<p>Hi I’m Athisa.</p>

<p>A student currently living in <em>Indonesia</em> with experiences studying abroad in <em>Japan</em>
and the <em>United States</em>. More specifically in the metropolitan city of <em>Jakarta</em>, gourmet center of
<em>Osaka</em>, and tech capital of <em>San Jose</em>.</p>

<p>I speak fluent <em>Indonesian</em> and <em>English</em>. At present, learning <em>Japanese</em>.</p>

<hr data-content="programming" />

<p>I started programming during high school using <em>C++</em> for competitive programming purposes.
This also lead me to learning <em>Python</em>, <em>Java</em>, and <em>Assembly</em>.</p>

<p>Throughout various Hackathons, I employ various <em>JavaScript</em> modules such as React and Node being the most common.</p>

<p>As with others, I also have an interest in <em>Machine Learning</em>. Taking Coursera lessons and experimenting
in Kaggle is one of my past hobbies.</p>

<hr data-content="anime &amp; weebiness" />

<p>The anime that started my journey towards anime was <em>K-On</em> which caught my attention because of the art style.
Since then I have watched over <em>400+ anime titles</em>. Some of my favorite anime are <em>Grand Blue</em>, <em>Youjo Senki</em>, and <em>Kokoro Connect</em>.</p>

<p>Light novels are manga are also some of my favorite reading medium. While I enjoy a broad range of manga the same cannot be said for
light novels.</p>
