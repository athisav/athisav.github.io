I"Ž<p>Virtual Youtubers or more commonly known as VTubers are becoming a hot topic
in the anime community lately. Whether it being clips in Twitter or fan arts being shared
in Pixiv, the rise of these idols are now seen across multiple platforms. What makes
these virtual idols popular among the anime loving masses? When did they start
getting popular and swarming my Youtube recommendation feed? These are some of the
questions I ask myself as I dig into my personal journey into Virtual Youtubers.</p>

<p>The year 2017, Donald Trump sworn into the oval office was the biggest
news around. However as for myself, there are better things to pay attention to
in the realm of programming and technology advancement. Browsing through Youtube
was a common occurrence for me in between college classes. One thing that caught my eye
was a Japanese video recommended to me from a channel called Kizuna AI.</p>
