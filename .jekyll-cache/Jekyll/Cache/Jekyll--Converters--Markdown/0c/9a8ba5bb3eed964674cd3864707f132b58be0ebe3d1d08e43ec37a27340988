<hr data-content="programming" />

<p>I started programming during high school using <em>C++</em> for competitive programming purposes.
This also lead me to learning <em>Python</em>, <em>Java</em>, and <em>Assembly</em>.</p>

in Kaggle is one of my past hobbies.</p>

<p>The anime that started my journey towards anime was <em>K-On</em> which caught my attention because of the art style.
Since then I have watched over 400+ anime titles.</p>
