<hr data-content="intro" />

<p>Hi I‚Äôm Athisa.</p>

<p>A student currently living in <em>Indonesia</em> with experiences studying abroad in <em>Japan</em>
and the <em>United States</em>. More specifically in the metropolitan city of <em>Jakarta</em>, gourmet center of
<em>Osaka</em>, and tech capital of <em>San Jose</em>.</p>

<p>I speak fluent <em>Indonesian</em> and <em>English</em>. At present, learning <em>Japanese</em>.</p>

<hr data-content="programming" />

<p>I started programming during high school using <em>C++</em> for competitive programming purposes.
This also lead me to learning <em>Python</em>, <em>Java</em>, and <em>Assembly</em>.</p>

<p>Throughout various Hackathons, I employ various <em>JavaScript</em> modules such as React and Node being the most common.</p>

<p>As with others, I also have an interest in <em>Machine Learning</em>. Taking Coursera lessons and experimenting
in Kaggle is one of my past hobbies.</p>

<hr data-content="anime &amp; weebiness" />

<p>The anime that started my journey towards anime was <em>K-On</em> which caught my attention because of the art style.
Since then I have watched over <em>400+ anime titles</em>. Some of my favorite anime are <em>Grand Blue</em>, <em>Youjo Senki</em>, and <em>Kokoro Connect</em>.</p>

<p>Light novels and mangas are also some of my favorite reading medium. While I enjoy a broad range of manga the same cannot be said for
light novels.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite mangas are <em>Spy X Family</em> and <em>Sengoku Komachi Kurou Tan!</em>. Light novels that I enjoy are few such as
<em>Isekai Tensei Soudoki</em> and <em>Common Sense of a Duke‚Äôs Daughter</em>.</p>

<p>The world of music and videos are nonetheless similar due to the fact that I consume more curated Japanese songs
and videos than the average man. Artists such as <em>Yorushika</em> and <em>Orangestar</em> dominate my daily playlist.</p>

<p>Personally, I also go on Youtube to get my daily dose of Virtual Youtuber clips from some of my favorite such as
<em>Usada Pekora</em>, <em>Minato Aqua</em>, and <em>Kagura Mea</em>.</p>

<hr data-content="games" />

<p>Video games have been a part of my life since I was little coming from a small Korean game called
<em>Lost Saga</em>. I eventually moved onto more popular games such as <em>League of Legends</em>, <em>Dota 2</em>, and <em>CS:GO</em>.</p>

<p>While I do play Dota 2, as a matter of fact I am more invested in <em>League of Legends</em> as I have played
since Season 2 in the North American server reaching high platinum by season 4. My favourite champion is <em>Lucian</em>.</p>

<p>Playing <em>CS:GO</em> was a blast during my high school days, I managed to reached LEM rank and stopped. I also sometimes play
<em>Apex Legends</em> but in a more casual manner.</p>

<p>However, my best time playing online games was <em>FINAL FANTASY XIV</em> the MMORPG.</p>
