I"]&<p>Virtual Youtubers or more commonly known as VTubers are becoming a hot topic
in the anime community lately. Whether it being clips in Twitter or fan arts being
shared in Pixiv, the rise of these idols are now seen across multiple platforms.
What makes these virtual idols popular among the anime loving masses? When did they
start getting popular and swarming my Youtube recommendations feed? These are some of the
questions I ask myself as I dig into my personal journey into Virtual Youtubers.</p>

<hr />

<p>The year 2017, Donald Trump was sworn into the oval office was the biggest
news around. However, as for me, there are better things to pay attention to
in the realm of programming and technology advancement. Browsing through Youtube
was a common occurrence for me in between college classes. One thing that caught my eye
was a Japanese video recommended to me from a channel called <em>Kizuna AI</em>. Having been
interested in Machine Learning and so forth I was very intrigued.</p>

<p>A glimpse of her channel showed me a variety of gaming videos and video logs. Watching her,
I was quite disappointed as it did not to be an artificially created video made by Machine
Learning as I had hoped. Her videos did not strike me fancy as they were mostly loud and fast
talking rants akin to popular gaming Youtubers. Further search results showed me a different channel
equally as popular named <em>Kaguya Luna</em>, this further worsened my impression on Virtual Youtubers as
she was even more rowdy. Nevertheless, their view counts and subscribers amount rather a lot surprising
me.</p>

<p>Over the years, memory of my encounter with the two Virtual Youtubers faded. There were mentions
of an incident concerning Kizuna AI that trended quite a while in Twitter. As a result, most of
Virtual Youtuber enthusiasts moved over to smaller and upcoming Virtual Youtubers. However, I was still not
convinced to partake in this form of entertainment. This fortunately changed during the late 2019 where my
preconceived ideas of Virtual Youtubers are challenged.</p>

<hr />

<p>Circulating through Twitter was a video of an anime-styled white fox singing “Scatman”, this quickly
garnered views and my attention was drawn towards it thinking about how impressive the Live2D animations
and creativity this video has. However, I quickly realized that this is a live-captured person singing
and not some edited masterpiece. This intrigued me even further as a few days later a popular mobile game,
Azur Lane, released some Virtual Youtuber inspired limited characters.</p>

<p>Clearly, the international anime community took notice as my Youtube recommendations started pouring
clips after clips of English translated Virtual Youtuber gameplay. Eventually I found myself watching
a translated clip on <em>Natsuiro Matsuri</em> mostly not expecting anything. Shocked, I found myself enjoying
myself more than I thought I would and this is coming from a background of not traditionally watching Youtubers.</p>

<p>Sooner or later, I found myself in a rabbit hole watching various Virtual Youtubers from a company called
<em>Hololive</em> and a select few from <em>Nijisanji</em>. Knowing this, I found my new guilty pleasure in watching daily
translated English clips and at times watching their livestreams.</p>

<p>Before long I notice that more and more people are watching these Virtual Youtubers particularly from the anime
community. Reddit posts filled up, Discords become more active, and Twitter posted more Virtual Youtuber related
tweets. A turning point for the international community was when <em>Hololive</em> decided to add <em>Kiryu Coco</em> an English
and Japanese speaking Virtual Youtuber. The fact that <em>Hololive</em> also noticed a market outside of Japan adding in
various Chinese Virtual Youtubers and Indonesian-English speaking Virtual Youtubers means that they noticed the
potential of a broader market.</p>

<p>At this point I only follow a number of Hololive clips and streams such as <em>Usada Pekora</em>, <em>Minato Aqua</em>, <em>Kiryu
Coco</em> and <em>Ayunda Risu</em>. Currently I do not really follow a lot of <em>Nijisanji</em> Virtual Youtubers since I believe
that <em>Hololive</em> has a more compelling livestreaming experience and detailed character roster. As of late I started
to speculate why the boom on Virtual Youtubers happened and what are their advantages as well as disadvantages
against conventional Youtubers or Twitch streamers.</p>

<hr />

<p>One of the most apparent reasons on why Virtual Youtubers is popular is because of their anime aesthetics.
Anime has always been a more passive type of art style, in the sense that we are consuming anime typed
entertainment more than we are interacting with them in a social sense. Watching anime or playing anime styled
video games forms a desire for us to interact with our favorite anime casts and personalities such as
our seasonal favorite characters.</p>

<p>Timing also plays a big role in the widespread popularity of Virtual Youtubers recently. With the COVID-19
pandemic going on since the early 2020’s, many of us have been stuck in our homes consuming endless amounts
of entertainment. Virtual Youtubers provide plentiful amounts of content for anime fans outside of the
traditional anime TV shows and movies. Self-made content such as video game streams grant the audiences
the ability to actively engage with their favorite Virtual Youtubers through Youtube chat or multiplayer
video games with the audiences.</p>

<p>Another important point of Virtual Youtubers are their fabricated backstories, whether it being an
anthropomorphic princess rabbit or a Japanese shrine maiden. These all add an interesting quality to their on
screen experience as they provide amusing role-play on top of their own unique personality. As some Virtual
Youtubers are more detached from their character’s backstories than others, this makes for sometimes a comical or
delightful view for the audience. An example would be <em>Otogibara Era</em> where she was supposed to be a ‘homely
young woman’ that dreams of a prince picking her up one day, however as she continued to stream her personality
shifted away from a typical fairy tale character to a more crass, vulgar, and short-tempered character.</p>

<p>What truly differentiates the regular live streamers from those of Virtual Youtubers are their appealing
personalities. Having to be behind an animated mask proves that the streamer has to have an engaging and
unique personality. This also differs with those streamers providing no cameras on their streams because
Virtual Youtubers can still show various amounts of reactions through their animated avatars. The combination
of these two things make viewing Virtual Youtubers a somewhat pleasant experience since we are getting the best
of both worlds, an engaging streamer with reactions but without the prejudice of appearances and past fame or
notoriety.</p>

<p>The element of spontaneity also allows Virtual Youtubers to supply the audience with meaningful
surprises in their everyday mundane lives. Most Virtual Youtubers do not have a set schedule of streaming
contrasting to more popular Twitch streamers. They typically plan and announce their stream a few hours
ahead to assure that audiences have ample time to prepare. Even so, their content of live-streaming are
unpredictable ranging from karaoke streams to gaming streams and even drawing streams.</p>

<p>During these typically two to three hours of live streams numerous amounts of hilarity or unplanned actions are
shown. As a majority of these livestreams are unscripted providing translators with clips they translate for the
international community to enjoy and laugh at. In turn, this creates a more memorable moment for all those
involved in the livestream and the community. This goes to show why more natural Virtual Youtubers
rise faster than those prepackaged or scripted ones.</p>

<p>A reason why viewers keep coming back to their favorite Virtual Youtubers is due to the fact that
they provide a feeling of closeness. When Virtual Youtubers play their on-screen character, as said before,
their real-life personalities sometimes blend into their character. When this happens, a feeling of
intimacy happens between the viewer and the Virtual Youtuber as their viewers feel special interacting in their
livestreams. An example of this would be <em>Usada Pekora</em> a usually happy-go-lucky VTuber, but during a
certain question and answer session cries because of the way she spoke of her hardships becoming a Virtual
Youtuber and essentially breaking her character.</p>

<p>Constant collabortions between Virtual Youtubers in their respective groups help foster for more
interesting content compared to traditional streamers. Virtual Youtuber companies also introduce
a system where they are released in batches instead of debuting in a single manner. This helps form
a close bond between members in the same batch and even more so in their respective companies. There are
also various inter-company collaborations albeit quite rare compared to former. Examples of collaborations
can include content such as board games, discussion streams, or even gameshows.</p>

<p>In comparison to the western dominated Twitch, Virtual Youtubers have a more clean and positive
chat experience. Whereas in Twitch, the community spams or overloads the chat with unproductive
and unfunny emotes usually with the intention to seek attention from the streamer. This is different
in the Virtual Youtuber world as chat is more of a tool to express your opinions and interact with the streamer,
sometimes the occasional emote to a tolerable amount. This makes interacting with the Virtual Youtuber a much more pleasant and engaing
event.</p>
