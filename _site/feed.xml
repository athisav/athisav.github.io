startups in the world coming from China. Although technology and the concept of startups were first bred in the
United States, unknowingly China has also seen a massive boom in the same sector. Since China has its internet
ecosystem hidden from the world, most people are not familiar with the changes that technology has brought upon
China’s society in recent years. Whether it is the popularization of contactless payment guided by WeChat, or e-
grocery shopping by Missfresh, and even a platform for doctors such as Good Doctor, China has some of the most
innovative startups backed by a government that is ready to invest and promote the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A question often asked by people looking into China for the first time has always been what are their Chinese
counterparts for famous American startups. While it always has not been that straightforward being that
multiple companies competing in a sector are quite common in China and that some of them might not have a
perfect American equivalent in that category. For example by its nature, Bilibili was not supposed to be a
YouTube substitute in China until recently where multiple news outlets reported so. But what is Bilibili? And
what makes it so appetizing for both Tencent and Alibaba to be investing in it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The journey towards my discovery of Bilibili was facilitated by a mobile video game called Honkai Impact 3.
This Chinese-made video game launched on the western market in the middle of 2018 with high praise reflecting
its superior graphics and amazing gameplay. Intrigued by the reviews on some publications, I hesitantly
downloaded it as I was not too sure about the quality of mobile video games at that time. Particularly affected
by games such as Candy Crush and FarmVille, I did not have high expectations going into the game only knowing
that it is anime-inspired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What awaits me was a 3D Action Role-playing game that is graphically impressive trumping even some billion-
dollar companies coupled with smooth controls in a smartphone. Aware of the fact that the video game was
developed in China, I was very curious whether there are similarly made mobile games of the highest quality.
Searching through the internet, I discovered a treasure trove of information with one of them being a website
called Bilibili.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Browsing through the website shows various videos catered towards fans of ACGs (Anime, Comics, and Games). The
first impression that I felt when analyzing this website was how much of a unique platform it is compared to a
video-sharing website such as YouTube. A “Mecca for Gen Z by Gen Z” is what I would describe this website to
be. A gathering place for young adults wishing for one-stop entertainment be it live streaming, video games, or
even shopping for their favorite character’s figures. However, as someone that does not speak Chinese, I could
not get myself immersed in the website enough to understand the content and full features they offer.
Eventually, I forgot about Bilibili.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2019, the boom of Virtual YouTubers attracted me towards Bilibili once again. As various
translated user-edited videos make its way towards YouTube from Bilibili, a lot of Virtual YouTuber fans start
to shift their attention towards the Chinese platform. As for myself, I started to understand the potential of
a creative user-based experience where content provided by the community has entertained me more than
television-inspired reality shows generic to YouTube. The question in my mind persists nonetheless on its
popularity in China and its relevance in the global market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bilibili, as explained before, is a website focused on animations and video games based in China. During the
early days of the website, they specifically specialize in ACG content as a fan website to Japanese culture
catering to the local enthusiasts. Over the years, they have grown as a company expanding their business and
monetization towards categories such as mobile games, advertising, and e-commerce. Coupled with their premium
memberships allowing access to various shows and high-quality video streaming, Bilibili has become one of
China’s biggest video platforms alongside Tencent video and iQiyi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the start of Bilibili as a platform, the specialization towards Japanese culture in a subject manner helps
form a very tight-knit community. This in turn allows Bilibili to retain a lot of their core audiences and even
grow their Monthly Active Users. Going year by year, they have increased in viewership since their demographic
is mostly students or young graduates born from 1990 or above. Engagement as a factor for these young viewers
also helps spread the word, by using “bullet comments” Bilibili has managed to improve its platform socially
compared to other video-sharing websites. Positivity in the community also helps Bilibili retain their viewers
and creators alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growth of Bilibili can be attributed to the growing ACG market in East Asia. Especially in regards to video
games, as most of Bilibili’s revenue in 2020 comes from mobile games licensed originating out of Japan or
China’s homemade indie mobile game market. Live streaming is also a big factor as the growth of eSports in the
Asian market keeps exponentially increasing, China, as one of the largest consumers of such entertainment needs
a platform such as Bilibili to host it. Recently, they have landed deals with various organizations around the
world to broadcast and translate their events in real-time. Compared to traditional platforms such as iQiyi and
Tencent video mentioned before, Bilibili’s focus on their audience’s interests helps them create a more
concentrated platform increasing their premium membership by a large amount in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though Bilibili might not be as popular in the mainstream compared to platforms such as Douyin or
Kuaishou, they still hold a significant portion of China’s users under 30. Compared to the other two
applications, Bilibili has another advantage over them which is the engagement factor of being involved in
organizing offline events. One such event is called BilibiliWorld hosted and organized by the company itself.
Corresponding to other major anime or video game-related conventions in the world, this event holds great
importance to the user base of the website. As various companies from outside of China come and showcase their
products, many of Bilibilis premium members get access to cheaper VIP tickets, discounted goods, and even
recorded videos of the event. Around the world, most conventions such as these are usually hosted by non-profit
organizations as such Bilibili holds the power to subsidize regular tickets allowing for normal users and even
untapped audiences to participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without major competition in the market, YouTube has knowingly been slacking in its content offerings and
their monetization policies. In turn, companies in China have been making substantial progress in
understanding what their user base wants. Take in case, Douyin or Tik Tok outside of China, they are one of
the most valuable startups in the world due to their excellence in predicting what their user base desire to
consume in a limited amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bilibili however does content recommendation more simply since their user base is mostly ACG focused.
Executives and employees in the company understand what their user base wants as they are ACG fans themselves.
This results in a plethora of video games both mobile and console to be licensed and published by Bilibili
further offering their premium audiences another reason to stay. Additionally, Bilibili also affords homegrown
animations and documentaries coupled with various other perks such as video game live streaming and online
tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As content is the primary factor in social media websites to hook their audiences, eventually what keeps them
as active users are their features combined with those content provided. Bilibili, unlike any other social
platform outside of China, offers a robust amount of supplementary options to keep ACG fans absorbed on the
website. On top of the usual videos on the website, Bilibili adopted “bullet comments” from a well known
Japanese streaming platform called NicoNico. These “bullet comments” fly across the screen offering various
users to customize the video for others to see. Bilibili’s technology also allows users to customize these
comments so that they can be colored, shaped, and animated differently. At first, it might seem distracting
but for regulars, they offer an experience quite similar to watching with friends. Also, Bilibili offers a
gamification system for their users to level up and unlock various customization for their profile and
comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As said before, what truly makes Bilibili unique is its commitment to the ACG community in China. Starting as
a new user, you will be asked to take a 100 question exam regarding ACGs. These questions involve knowledge
concerning Japanese culture, animation, and video games with some questions asking about Bilibili’s terms of
service and ethics on the website. While another website tends to make registering as easy as possible,
Bilbili on the other hand does the opposite. But to this effect, the community has a higher engagement rate
compared to other social platforms. Rules are also enforced quite strictly as those who pass the test are
already screened making the community quite positive allowing the company to introduce risky features.
Features like “bullet comments” for example can be used to troll other viewers but Bilibili’s community and
management is well equipped to handle such users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet with all these advantages, Bilibili has been suffering an identity and financial crisis. Since its IPO in
2018, the website has substantially increased in net revenue but its net profits remain in the negatives. This
comes in a time when their Monthly Active User and Monthly Paying Users skyrocket year over year. Moreover,
YouTube has beaten Bilibili in the category of revenue sharing with its content creators by a large margin.
Another major problem would be that Bilbili has the majority of its revenue coming from mobile games both
overseas and locally. In the future, they need to strive to turn a positive profit while diversifying their
source of revenue and increase their content creators incentive to stay in the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both founders and co-founders of the company also struggle with the fact that their approach to business is
very passive, appearing indifferent to both publicity and profits. Sooner or later the company will have to
realize that to achieve profitability they may have to sacrifice some of their values. This includes a change
in the website’s community and its contents, moreover, this can already be seen today as the questions to
register as a Bilibili member has been easier than previous years. As content imported and licensed from Japan
are rather limited, Bilibili has offered to add Chinese animations and movies onto their platform, however,
this cannot keep going on as the former is a very niche market in the ACG community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the problem of lacking local content and creators alike, the executives at the company pulled the lever
adopting the strategy of expansion. Many more mainstream artists and advertisement topics are shown on
Bilibili in the past few months. In addition to the ease in user acquirement, this has lead to a mass influx
of users resulting in the previously mentioned increase in Monthly Active Users which greatly benefits them.
This does come with the immense drawbacks of their original user base being very unhappy. Resulting in a very
few dedicated ACG fans leaving the platform and moving into others while a good majority still stands as
active users. Overall, Bilibili has seen a major change lately for better or for worse. Most of their user
base is not happy with the changes coming as this will undoubtedly change the tight-knit community into a
somewhat mainstream platform going the way of YouTube or Youku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I still believe Bilibili is a great platform for the millions of ACG fans in China. As the war
rages between core audiences and new members of Bilibili’s community, I hope to see both founders find a
solution to expanding their company and bringing in more profits through diversification without hurting ACG
enthusiasts. A potential I see for the company is to enter both the Korean and Southeast Asian markets. They
need to realize that there is still untapped potential to create a one-stop-shop for ACG fans in those
regions. Whether it is through licensing Japanese animation, creating a global game store, or helping Chinese
and Japanese streamers localize their content, there are many supporters waiting for such a platform.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>athisa goh</name></author><summary type="html">Ant Financial, DiDi, Pinduoduo, you might not recognize these names, but they are some of the highest-valued startups in the world coming from China.

Whether it being clips in Twitter or fan arts being shared in Pixiv, the rise of these idols are now seen
across multiple platforms. What makes these virtual idols popular among the anime-loving masses? When did they
start getting popular and swarming my Youtube recommendations feed? These are some of the questions I ask
myself as I dig into my journey regarding Virtual Youtubers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year 2017, Donald Trump sworn into the oval office was the biggest news around. However, as for me, there
are better things to pay attention to in the realm of programming and technology advancement. Browsing through
Youtube was a common occurrence for me in between college classes. One thing that caught my eye was a Japanese
video recommended to me from a channel called Kizuna AI. Having been interested in Machine Learning and so
forth I was very intrigued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A glimpse of her channel showed me a variety of gaming videos and video logs. Watching her, I was quite
disappointed as it was not an artificially created video made by Machine Learning as I had hoped. Her videos
did not strike me fancy as they were mostly loud and fast-talking rants akin to popular gaming YouTubers.
Further search results showed me a different channel equally as popular named Kaguya Luna, this further
worsened my impression on Virtual Youtubers as she was even rowdier. Nevertheless, their view counts and
subscribers amount rather a lot surprising me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, the memory of my encounter with the two Virtual Youtubers faded. There were mentions of an
incident concerning Kizuna AI that trended quite a while on Twitter. As a result, most of the Virtual Youtuber
enthusiasts moved over to smaller and upcoming Virtual Youtubers. However, I was still not convinced to partake
in this form of entertainment. This fortunately changed during late 2019 where my preconceived ideas of Virtual
Youtubers are challenged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Circulating through Twitter was a video of an anime-styled white fox singing “Scatman”, this quickly garnered
views and my attention was drawn towards it thinking about how impressive the Live2D animations and creativity
this video has. However, I quickly realized that this is a live-captured person singing and not some edited
masterpiece. This intrigued me even further as a few days later a popular mobile game, Azur Lane, released some
Virtual Youtuber inspired limited characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quickly, the international anime community took notice as my Youtube recommendations started pouring clips
after clips of English translated Virtual Youtuber gameplay. Eventually, I found myself watching a translated
clip on Natsuiro Matsuri mostly not expecting anything. Shocked, I found myself enjoying it more than I thought
I would and this is coming from a background of not traditionally watching Youtubers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sooner or later, I found myself in a rabbit hole watching various Virtual Youtubers from a company called
Hololive and a select few from Nijisanji. Knowing this, I found my new guilty pleasure in watching daily
translated English clips and at times watching their livestreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before long I notice that more and more people are watching these Virtual Youtubers, particularly from the
anime community. Reddit posts filled up, Discords become more active, and Twitter posted more Virtual Youtuber
related tweets. A turning point for the international community was when Hololive decided to add Kiryu Coco an
English and Japanese speaking Virtual Youtuber. The fact that Hololive also noticed a market outside of Japan
adding in various Chinese Virtual Youtubers and Indonesian-English speaking Virtual Youtubers means that there
is a growing demand for them outside of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I only follow several Hololive clips and streams such as Usada Pekora, Minato Aqua, Kiryu Coco,
and Ayunda Risu. Currently, I do not follow a lot of Nijisanji Virtual Youtubers since I believe that Hololive
has a more compelling livestreaming experience and detailed character roster. As of late, I started to
speculate why the boom on Virtual Youtubers happened and what are their advantages as well as disadvantages
against conventional YouTubers or Twitch streamers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most apparent reasons why Virtual Youtubers are popular is because of their anime aesthetics. Anime
has always been a more passive type of art style, in the sense that we are consuming anime typed entertainment
more than we are interacting with them in a social sense. Watching anime or playing anime-styled video games
forms a desire for us to interact with our favorite anime casts and personalities such as our seasonal favorite
characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timing also plays a big role in the widespread popularity of Virtual Youtubers recently. With the COVID-19
pandemic going on since the early 2020s, many of us have been stuck in our homes consuming endless amounts of
entertainment. Virtual Youtubers provide plentiful amounts of content for anime fans outside of the
traditional anime TV shows and movies. Self-made content such as video game streams grants the audiences the
ability to actively engage with their favorite Virtual Youtubers through Youtube chat or multiplayer video games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important point of Virtual Youtubers is their fabricated backstories, whether it being an
anthropomorphic princess rabbit or a Japanese shrine maiden. These all add an interesting quality to their on-
screen experience as they provide amusing role-play on top of their unique personality. As some Virtual
Youtubers are more detached from their character’s backstories than others, this makes for sometimes a comical
or delightful view for the audience. An example would be Otogibara Era where she was supposed to be a ‘homely
young woman’ that dreams of a prince picking her up one day, however as she continued to stream her
personality shifted away from a typical fairy tale character to a more crass, vulgar, and short-tempered
character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What truly differentiates the regular live streamers from those of Virtual Youtubers are their appealing
personalities. Having to be behind an animated mask proves that the streamer has to have an engaging and
unique personality. This also differs from those streamers providing no cameras on their streams because
Virtual Youtubers can still show various amounts of reactions through their animated avatars. The combination
of these two things makes viewing Virtual Youtubers a somewhat pleasant experience since we are getting the
best of both worlds, an engaging streamer with reactions but without the prejudice of appearances and past
fame or notoriety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The element of spontaneity also allows Virtual Youtubers to supply the audience with meaningful surprises in
their everyday mundane lives. Most Virtual Youtubers do not have a set schedule of streaming contrasting to
more popular Twitch streamers. They typically plan and announce their stream a few hours ahead to assure that
audiences have ample time to prepare. Even so, their content of live-streaming is unpredictable ranging from
karaoke streams to gaming streams and even drawing streams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During these typically two to three hours of live streams numerous amounts of hilarity or unplanned actions
are shown. As a majority of these livestreams are unscripted providing translators with clips they translate
for the international community to enjoy and laugh at. In turn, this creates a more memorable moment for all
those involved in the livestream and the community. This goes to show why more natural Virtual Youtubers rise
faster than those prepackaged or scripted ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reason why viewers keep coming back to their favorite Virtual Youtubers is that they provide a feeling of
closeness. When Virtual Youtubers play their on-screen character, as said before, their real-life
personalities sometimes blend into their character. When this happens, a feeling of intimacy happens between
the viewer and the Virtual Youtuber as their viewers feel special interacting in their livestreams. An example
of this would be Usada Pekora a usually happy-go-lucky VTuber, but during a certain question and answer
session cries because of the way she spoke of her hardships becoming a Virtual Youtuber and essentially
breaking her character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constant collaborations between Virtual Youtubers in their respective groups help foster for more interesting
content compared to traditional streamers. Virtual Youtuber companies also introduce a system where they are
released in batches instead of debuting exclusively. This helps form a close bond between members in the same
batch and even more so in their respective companies. There are also various inter-company collaborations
albeit quite rare compared to the former. Examples of collaborations can include content such as board games,
discussion streams, or even gameshows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comparison to the western dominated Twitch, Virtual Youtubers have a more clean and positive chat
experience. Whereas in Twitch, the community spams or overloads the chat with unproductive and unfunny emotes
usually intending to seek attention from the streamer. This is different in the Virtual Youtuber world as chat
is more of a tool to express your opinions or interact with the streamer, and sometimes the occasional emote
to a tolerable amount. This makes interacting with the Virtual Youtuber a much more pleasant and engaging
event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donations or Super Chats are paid text sent to the streamer to highlight messages, Twitch streamers often read
it aloud in between gameplay showcasing a distracting viewing experience. While Virtual Youtubers take their
time after this gameplay ends to read aloud their names and message creating a more appreciative feeling for
the premium viewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all aspects of Virtual Youtubers are positive, as they are sometimes given the idol treatment by their
companies. However Virtual Youtubers are more immune to leaks of personal information compared to normal
streamers. Even then this does not change the fact that they are still responsible for drama caused by
themselves. There have been a few terminated contracts in the Virtual Youtuber world because of bad acts
caused by the Virtual Youtuber as an individual or the company being inflexible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, in a personal note, I find Virtual Youtubers to be a very interesting form of entertainment offering a
more unique and positive alternative to traditional streamers. Even so, the biggest question remains of
whether Hololive and the other companies can still maintain their enormous growth after the pandemic ends.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>athisa goh</name></author><summary type="html">Virtual Youtubers or more commonly known as VTubers are becoming a hot topic in the anime community lately.
